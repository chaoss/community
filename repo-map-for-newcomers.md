# CHAOSS Repository Map for New Contributors

The CHAOSS GitHub organization hosts several repositories, each focused on a specific part of community health analytics. This guide helps new contributors quickly identify where they can start based on their interests and experience level.

## Where to Contribute

### Community processes, governance, and contributor onboarding

If you are new to CHAOSS or open source contributions, this is the best place to begin.

- **community**  
  https://github.com/chaoss/community

This repository contains contribution guidelines, governance documents, mentoring information, and general discussions. Documentation improvements and onboarding-related contributions are especially welcome here.

### Research, metrics, and data science work

For contributors interested in understanding, defining, and analyzing community health metrics:

- **wg-data-science**  
  https://github.com/chaoss/wg-data-science

This repository focuses on metric definitions, research discussions, and data science approaches used across CHAOSS projects.

### Data collection tools and infrastructure

For contributors who want to work on tooling and backend systems used to collect community data:

- **grimoirelab-perceval**  
  https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-perceval

- **grimoirelab-sirmordred**  
  https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-sirmordred

These repositories are part of the GrimoireLab toolchain and handle data collection and processing from multiple platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, and Bugzilla.

## Getting Started Tips

New contributors are encouraged to start with documentation updates, small fixes, or discussion-based contributions before moving on to larger code changes. Reviewing open issues labeled as “good first issue” or “documentation” is a great way to become familiar with the project structure and workflows.
