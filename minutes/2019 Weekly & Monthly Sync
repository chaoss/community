            *   chaoss.community/metrics-rc
        *   The page at [https://chaoss.community/metrics/](https://chaoss.community/metrics/) will always be the most current release
        *   Historical releases will be available from that page as PDF
            *   v1: [https://chaoss.community/wp-content/uploads/sites/51/2019/08/CHAOSS-Metrics-Release-201908.pdf](https://chaoss.community/wp-content/uploads/sites/51/2019/08/CHAOSS-Metrics-Release-201908.pdf)

            *   New metrics

    *   It required a lot of work to figure out how to display something in the browser and have the print version look great as well
    *   There is a particular column width that is most effective for reading based on eye and head movement.
    *   Approach puts accessibility as a top concern and wants to deliver reliably between different delivery media

Notes:



*   Metrics deployment 
    *   New templates are being deployed slowly but surely by Matt. 
    *   Tracking available at: 
        *   [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tAGzUiZ9jdORKCnoDQJkOU8tQsZDCZVjcWqXYOSAFmE/edit#gid=276406255](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tAGzUiZ9jdORKCnoDQJkOU8tQsZDCZVjcWqXYOSAFmE/edit#gid=276406255) 
    *   Jenkins X and Zephyr as communities that we will work with to build an overview document to represent community health. This document will be built using CHAOSS metrics
        *   Jenkins X: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UFTdot85eCshrAyh6ccthWCJfRQTFyydTcKiK8N2owM/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UFTdot85eCshrAyh6ccthWCJfRQTFyydTcKiK8N2owM/edit) 
        *   Zephyr: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TU6jPapFoceOHJSD9f_xYCeodWw-LoSNVpDcYW4cnMQ/edit#](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TU6jPapFoceOHJSD9f_xYCeodWw-LoSNVpDcYW4cnMQ/edit#) 
        *   The goal is to produce a 1-page PDF and engage the communities in conversations about what these metrics mean to them. 
        *   The feedback will be good for refining the metric, identify any unclarities, and look for use cases of using the metrics in these communities.
        *   Another benefit of producing these reports is to show use cases of how the CHAOSS metrics are used. This can give us more material for outreach and marketing of CHAOSS.
        *   Example 1:
            *   Envoy project journey: [https://www.cncf.io/cncf-envoy-project-journey/](https://www.cncf.io/cncf-envoy-project-journey/)
            *   [https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/CNCF_Envoy_Project_Journey_Report.pdf](https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/CNCF_Envoy_Project_Journey_Report.pdf) 
        *   Example 2: 
            *   Uber community report: [https://drive.google.com/a/bitergia.com/file/d/17NasQkwbNnIKfEIrlHBbdbBYgBvVR0W5/view](https://drive.google.com/a/bitergia.com/file/d/17NasQkwbNnIKfEIrlHBbdbBYgBvVR0W5/view)
        *   Proposed next steps: 
            *   in future meetings, we can determine the action items required for creating these reports. Volunteers can take on action items. Every week, we check in and progress, little by little.
    *   D&I Badging Program: 
        *   Cross referenced from D&I Meeting: 
            *   Matt looking at D&I badging for events and projects using our existing released metrics to walk people through the metrics to see if they meet the requirements. All of this is done in the open, and then the project / event get a badge. 
            *   We would need to actively promote this to make it work. We could start with some LF projects or other conferences. Maybe something like [https://devopsdays.org/](https://devopsdays.org/) [https://devopsdays.org/organizing](https://devopsdays.org/organizing) to certify some of the individual city events.
            *   The workflow to get people into the badging process could include some templates and other information to help them be more inclusive. 
            *   Concern is that right now, we only have a few of the D&I metrics released, and they aren’t really the most important.
            *   It probably makes sense to roll this out later. We would definitely need to re-certify periodically.
            *   Right now, it might make sense to focus on events & maybe focus our second release on the event metrics.
    *   Software
        *   We’ve had this approach to identify every CHAOSS metric for every visual in Grimoire Lab and Augur
        *   Maybe a more sensible approach may be to simply have a note on the front page (or something) of each piece of software that says something like: 
            *   “Metrics available in GL/Augur are, in part, developed in the CHAOSS project. For more information regarding CHAOSS metrics, see the latest release at: [https://chaoss.community/metrics/](https://chaoss.community/metrics/)”
        *   **AI Augur/GrimoireLab:** Think about where in the software and website to have a link back to the metrics.
            *   **Augur**: Already implemented in API documentation.
            *   **AI Daniel:** Open a GL issue.

Notes:



1. What to do about Google docs? 
    *   The concern → All of the minutes are in Google Docs and it is possible that the owner of the document may leave the organization and access to the google docs may be lost (We use Google docs across all of our WGs)
    *   Solutions: 
        1. Create MD to store the Google docs in the respective repos (there is a plugin to export Markdown)
        2. Create free google account for CHAOSS → Manage by governing board 
        3. Export out as PDF
        4. Send out minutes to mailing list 
    *   Proposal to the mailing list:
        5. Create a free google account to take ownership.
        6. Working groups can decide whether they prefer mailing list and/or markdown as their way to archive and/or PDF in repo
    *   Perhaps have a plan B if Google docs use becomes problematic globally 
        7. Maybe collaborative markdown editor: [https://hackmd.io/](https://hackmd.io/) 
2. Software Efforts -- Hearing from representatives from CHAOSS software projects around current action items as well as what is on their respective roadmaps.
    *   The Software groups have been meeting weekly, open to everyone
    *   Augur
        8. Doing a Grace Hopper workshop on Thursday (October 3)
        9. Including machine learning 
            1. Identifying trends and things that are outside of a certain tolerance 
        10. Updates to the interface 
            2. Working to improve user experience 
    *   GrimoireLab
        11. Documentation improvements and minor improvements to the platform
        12. The Working Group meeting had discussed a Common WG Metric “Hours and Times” and implemented changes. Next a visualization needs to be added to sigils.
        13. Looking to GL as a service 
            3. Have a try at [https://alpha.cauldron.io](https://alpha.cauldron.io) !! (GrimoireLab as a service, still in early alpha testing)
            4. What’s the use-case of cauldron? -- You don’t want to deploy GrimoireLab. Just provide the repositories you want to analyze. Wait for the data collection. After some time, the data is available.
            5. The data is stripped of personal information.
            6. The visualizations right now are “random”; it is a proof of concept; at some point the visualizations should be the CHAOSS metrics
                1. Comments: (1) a big win to allow anyone to do metrics; (2) it is important to be attentive to what to aggregate and show people. People may not even modify visualizations and just use what is provided. This is a lot of influence we may have
            7. Data needs to be collected only once and is shared across all users.
3. Metrics Template -- Discussion around reworking the template structure just a bit to be more consistent across working groups and highlight what the metric is about:
    *   **Description (required)**
    *   **Objectives (required)**
    *   **Implementation (required)**
        14. Filters (optional)
        15. Visualizations (optional)
        16. Tools providing metric (was: known or sample implementations) (optional)
        17. Data Collection Strategies (optional)
        18. Success Metrics (optional) -- maybe reword this (To be discussed in the D&I WG)
    *   **Resources (required)**

**	**This would require a rework of all metrics that were released in the first version. 



    *   Discussion during the call:
        19. The Success Metrics heading is confusing because metrics inside of metrics is not logical.
        20. The metric = number definition seems to not apply in the D&I WG use of the word “metric”. 
4. Working Group Efforts -- Hearing from working groups around their current action items as well as goals over the next few months leading up to CHAOSScon Europe
    *   Skipped this week.
5. CHAOSS Outreach -- this includes CHAOSScon Europe / Website / Social Media / Contributions
    *   CHAOSScon
        21. CFP PR: https://github.com/chaoss/website/pull/226
        22. Hotel will be booked by Bitergia, then reimbursed through CommunityBridge
    *   Website
        23. There is a pull request for adding the Software WG calls to the /participate page: [https://github.com/chaoss/website/pull/225](https://github.com/chaoss/website/pull/225)
        24. Embed a calendar on the /community page
    *   Communications Group
        25. Group is forming from the responses to the mailing list discussion.
        26. Next: call for meeting. Organize the responsibilities and tasks.

Notes: 



*   Innersource Commons 
    *   What we can we learn from CHAOSS
*   Innersource
    *   Bringing open source work practices into the organizational boundaries. 
    *   The idea is that they can learn from the way that open source is developed 
    *   Some of the metrics seems to map between IS and OS
    *   From an innersource perspective, organizations are seeking to use metrics to provide greater transparency on the work. 
        *   Using metrics to understand collaboration 
        *   Using metrics to determine retention rates in projects 
        *   Considering how metrics are related to money
    *   Consortiums or partnerships 
        *   To help ensure equitable contributions or value 
    *   Perhaps folks from Innersource commons folks could serve in an advisory role for the Value WG
*   **AI: Andy** provide a one-page overview of what advisory committee would look like and what the roles would be 
*   Metrics Release V2
    *   Work to map between the software and the metrics
    *   This includes identifying deployed metrics in software
        *   Bring these forward as metrics for V2
    *   Work to deploy V1 in software as appropriate 
*   Provide an annual report (flyer) for an open source project 
    *   how about a commercial-open source company and ask them for sponsorship and to cover development costs red-hat, salt-stack, netflix, disney, …
    *   We would use CHAOSS metrics in the report 
        *   We work with communities to reduce the metrics that are meaningful to the community

        *   We may identify one metric that is available across all organizations 
            *   Perhaps like project velocity 
            *   Something that can be put forward as something that is recognizable as CHAOSS 
                *   Perhaps one way to think about this in agnostic way 
    *   Perhaps create a showcase for one organization 
*   Diversity & Inclusion 
    *   ASF and the work that is being done on ASF projects with respect to D&I
        *   The last survey they did was in 2016

Notes: 



*   Introductions of Samantha and Dylan from SociallyConstructed.Online
*   Ways to deal with qualitative data (social scientific methodology)
*   Demo of the The Social Currency Metrics System
    *   Oversimplified version of Grounded Theory Method and Social Currency Theory
    *   Process:
        *   1. Collect multi-channel qualitative sentiment
        *   2. Standardize sentiment analysis with codex
        *   3. Categorizing sentiment with keyword terms
        *   4. Analyze data for patterns and compile results
        *   5. Set Benchmarks & Predictive Lead Metrics
        *   6. Evaluate Pitfalls & Adjust the System
    *   Social currency as
        *   Transparency 
        *   Utility 
        *   Consistency 
        *   Merit
        *   Trust 
    *   Implementation process
        *   Week 1: ask company for definitions, lurk on community
        *   Week 2: go to community and ask for definitions
        *   Week 3: define when to use Social Currency tags and when not to use
        *   Week 4: begin the process of analysis, training community managers
    *   Questions:
        *   What is the difference between Reputation and Social Currency?
            *   Social Currency focuses on the individual comments from people, Reputation is the larger concept.
        *   Unit of analysis is the entire post?
            *   Yes, the review or comment.
            *   What about long comment?
            *   We saw a demo, that is meant to be simplified. For larger pieces of information, the system could automatically use line-breaks.
        *   How were the categories defined? What is the logic for choosing the tag names for categories?
            *   It is based on the anthropological coding. The goal is to break the data into about 10 categories, to show repeating patterns. When trends emerged from looking at a lot of data, they may be chosen as categories. 
        *   Categories are data derived by community mangers who want to understand the community?
            *   “Proof is in the trend, power is in the pattern.”
        *   How to collect the right data?
            *   An inherent issue with dealing with analytics. Need to 
        *   The categories column is the “grounded theory” part. Who is deriving the categories? Is it the SociallyConstructed.Online service only, or is it something that others who want to analyze the community can do?
            *   The heart of the system was born out of the frustration that people ignored qualitative data and the social aspect of communities was not captured. Boiling down the Qualitative analysis resulted in the Social Currency Metrics - it is a simplification of something that is inherently complex. The complexity does not have to be thrown out and can be added back into the system, e.g., by adding a new column. A key part, however, is consistency in the analysis and between people executing the analysis.
            *   There is a problem with people who are not trained to analyze qualitative data. There is always going to be the question whether guidelines will be followed and the implementation will be successful. (This is why we focus so much on training and implementation, and it’s the same issue Google Analytics has)
        *   Who is the target market for this system? How do you measure success?

                *   Analysts
                *   Marketers

        *   Is it a SaaS or Consultancy?
            *   It is a business installation. 
            *   Work with company to establish system
            *   Train the people
        *   **We will continue the conversation about Social Currency Metrics System on the mailing list. A goal of the conversation is to understand the system and what parts we may want to standardize as part of the CHAOSS metrics.**

    *   Are there CoC for SM activity? Should this even be an issue? Actually, this already exists in the current CHAOSS CoC
*   Connecting roles and metrics:

    *   Dashboards are likely going to be collections of metrics. These metrics may very well come from a variety of different WGs and Focus areas
        *   The collections are based on problems 
        *   The collections are based on roles 
        *   The collections are based on experience 
        *   Perhaps reference collections based on organizations?

    *   Perhaps some reference collections for people to start from 
        *   Once people learn what they actually need, or their requirements change, people need to adjust the metrics they look at
    *   Reference collections as a version? Like metrics? 
    *   Sample collections: [https://chaoss.github.io/grimoirelab-sigils/](https://chaoss.github.io/grimoirelab-sigils/) 
    *   Other options could be an API 
    *   Composite metrics vs. collection of metrics
        *   “Reference Collections” that show people sets of metrics that people working with CHAOSS and its tools might have suggested.  \
I think a composite metric is a single data or visual representation of the information resulting when you merge several discrete metrics together in a particular way. For example, one could weight “activity” differently for issues and commits to show an aggregate of “activity” across repositories. Metric collections maintain the discrete values for each of the metrics in the collection. So, composite is highly customizable, IMHO Composite == “Pro Level” \
Collection == “Starting level"

*   Google Summer of Code
*   CHAOSScon North America
*   CHAOSS on Social Media
*   Working Group Updates
*   Software Updates

Notes:



*   Attendees: Matt Germonprez, Armstrong Foundjem, Dawn Foster, Andy Leak, Ildiko Vancsa, Brian Proffitt, Jon Lawrence, Georg Link, Kevin Lumbard, Jesus Gonzalez-Barahona, Vinod Ahuja

**Metrics Version 1 Release: **

	[https://chaoss.community/metrics-rc/](https://chaoss.community/metrics-rc/)



*   **AI all: **Please take a look at the page and use the link to issues to provide feedback. Please also post positive comments (i.e., +1 type comments).
*   Please advertise the release on social media. More and broader feedback is good.
*   Feedback: When someone sees the metric detail page, it does not show the link to the feedback issue. 
    *   **AI Kevin: **Create a pull request for each WG, to add a link to the top of each metric page.

**Google Summer of Code**



*   We have 4 very active and successful students.
*   Please read the weekly blog posts and comment on them.
*   We cleared the first evaluation period of GSoC - all reviews were completed.
*   The way Google pays out the project, they pay directly into the Linux Foundation account. The money should be moved into Community Bridge. Matt is working with the LF to sort out the logistics.

**CHAOSScon North America**



*   We have two keynotes set
    *   [Jana Gallus](http://www.janagallus.com/) from UCLA - talk about Rewards in Community Engagement
    *   [Zaheda Bhorat](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zaheda-bhorat-143121/) from AWS - talk about Decision Making using metrics - need to get a title, abstract and bio from her.
*   Schedule will go live on the website soon
    *   **AI Georg:** Publish Schedule.
*   We will have coffee/tea and snacks during morning and afternoon break
*   We will have a banner to thank the sponsors
*   We have two rooms
    *   One room is dedicated to talks
    *   One room is dedicated to workshops

**CHAOSS on Social Media**



*   Twitter: [https://twitter.com/chaossproj](https://twitter.com/chaossproj)
*   Should we do something more or different on social media?
*   What are the goals for social media?
    *   Get more people come to our website
    *   Establish CHAOSS as thought leaders on all things metrics
*   Reach out to LF in advance of announcements

We could use a social media strategy - actually written out. **@jon lawrence** will take this on. Define the why, the how and the what so contributors can come in and out of the project but have a common objective. 



*   Work to have a reference implementation and promote this. In essence -- keep it simple not complex (if we can tie the implementation and the metric to a *decision point* about development process, we can start telling the story of why these metrics are important to people beyond statisticians and data scientists too:) 
*   Georg: I wanted to say that Jesus created the Twitter account. He, Kevin, and I have access, we should add more people who are willing to execute a social media strategy.
    *   Who wants access?
        *   (please enter your name here)
*   Generally we are working to build the working group set of folks. We would like to grow the groups with respect to asynchronous participation. And particular working groups would like a few more participants :) 

**Working Group Updates**



*   Evolution is progressing with documentation 
*   Should the software being part of metrics release as coming from the metrics release?
*   What is the level of detail that needs to be provided in the release metrics regarding the reference implementations?
*   Having a reference implementation is going to be optional for a particular metric at the moment
*   We will have to have a discussion and process for syncing software with metric releases.

**Software Updates**



*   No updates

    *   CFP is closed
    *   Planning committee is reviewing submissions, will meet and make decision later this week.
    *   Registration is closed - we are full; We have 100 people registered
    *   We can track no-show rate and then consider having a small registration fee to make sure people only sign up if they are truly planning to come
    *   Anyone who is registering now, is told to be added to a waitlist.
    *   Can we get a list of names of people who registered and who are waitlisted?
        *   yes, maybe before our CFP review meeting on Friday
        *   Check list to make sure it includes our speakers, our core community members
    *   Maybe we can assemble a panel from the people who are registered
    *   We have two sponsors: 
        *   Gold Sponsor: Red Hat 
        *   Silver Sponsor: Bitergia
    *   **AI Kevin:** Update website to include sponsors on conference page
*   Release of Metrics - version 1
    *   Feature freeze deadline is June 21st: This means that working groups submit their metrics for the review period.
        *   D&I WG has about 5
        *   Risk WG has about a dozen
        *   Value WG has none right now
        *   Common WG has maybe 3
        *   Evolution WG has several
    *   Release will be nice to point people to. Start conversations. 
    *   Release technicality
        *   Release on website
        *   One page on website
        *   A sub-page for every metric on website
        *   Work continues to be in WG repositories
    *   Release mock-up:
        *   [https://chaoss.community/metrics-rc/](https://chaoss.community/metrics-rc/) 
    *   How do we want to handle the comment phase for the release candidate?
        *   This is the 1 Month open comment phase that the Governing Board decided to have
        *   Is there a way to do it in GitHub?
        *   Maybe create an issue on GitHub where people can comment on. This may be one issue per WG **or** one issue per metric **or** one per focus area.
        *   The people on the call seem to prefer a one issue per metric option. This requires opening an issue for each metric and linking to it from the release candidate front page - we can have a third column “provide feedback” that links to these issues. This third column will be removed for the final release
*   Working Group updates?
    *   Common: is working on metrics for release and is meeting weekly to prepare for the release
    *   Risk: Working on metrics
    *   D&I: Working on metrics
*   How are WGs working on metrics?
    *   Some WGs are working in google docs and creating a pull request to submit the changes. This seems to be good for collaborative reviewing of metrics during meetings.
*   Software updates?
    *   Augur: development work is going well. Mostly managing GSoC development.
        *   Moving to a consolidated data model
        *   Working on demo versions
    *   GrimoireLab: working on backend
        *   Preparing a easy to use tutorial - docker container
        *   Experimenting with how to show in CHAOSS metrics can include information for how to get the metric in the CHAOSS GrimoireLab software: [https://github.com/chaoss/wg-evolution/pull/163](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-evolution/pull/163)

Meeting minutes:



*   Google Season of Docs did not accept us.
*   Google Summer of Code - Mentors have selected students to mentor - Announcement will be made by Google
*   Grace Hopper - we submitted ideas for the hack day - we will hear back early May
*   CommunityBridge application - we were accepted as an organization. More to come once we have the account setup
*   CHAOSScon organizing committee is forming. Anyone interested, please fill out the Doodle poll to indicate your availability for a first kick-off meeting.
    *   [https://doodle.com/poll/kixfhc9ayei34usz](https://doodle.com/poll/kixfhc9ayei34usz)
*   Risk WG update
    *   Threads: 1) Security; 2) Safety critical systems
    *   Question: how can we inform these threads through metrics
    *   Sustainability of a community is a business risk - concern that a community goes away
    *   Project’s intended support window for a release
        *   Standard way to express support windows
        *   Standard way of expressing versioning schema
        *   Partly this is educating procurement people on how to observe indicators
        *   Partly this is about giving projects new tools
    *   Safety critical system concerns are partially covered by the CII best practices badge
        *   A risk metric may focus on a sub-set of criteria from the best practices badge
        *   Maybe it would make sense for CHAOSS to obtain a CII best practices badge for itself.
        *   Maybe the software projects can obtain a badge for themselves
        *   The CHAOSS project (metrics committee and working groups) can get one badge to revise the governance of the project
*   D&I WG update
    *   LF is putting together a survey that projects could deploy to better understand their own project D&I - will revise with help of D&I WG
*   Value WG update
    *   Calls every Friday morning US time 
    *   Close to having a working instance of some of the value metrics in Augur 
    *   Exploring grant funding

    *   Meeting coming up on Thursday 
*   Evolution WG update 
    *   Nothing to report 
*   Request for WGs to please continue to reflect on metrics for release:

Notes:



*   Google Season of Docs
    *   **AI Matt:** Express to LF that CHAOSS D&I is interested.
*   Google Summer of Code
    *   Deadline for students to apply is in two hours.
    *   **AI Georg:** Check submissions for completeness in our chaoss/governance and with Google Summer of Code.
*   Value WG
    *   Ability to extract value related information from public information 
    *   Value WG is looking for a developer who would like to implement 
    *   **AI Andy:** Put together a document of what metrics need implementing and what might be required.
    *   **AI Georg:** Create a pull request to add focus areas to Value WG README
*   Risk WG
    *   Five focus areas
        *   [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HMfLlWMR8t8c3B0zm3KiIeI-GR7E2ylYOEuGB3fl1_c/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HMfLlWMR8t8c3B0zm3KiIeI-GR7E2ylYOEuGB3fl1_c/edit)
    *   Follow established CHAOSS WG process
    *   **AI ???:** Update chaoss/metrics repo and tag metrics the Risk WG is working on.
*   Levels of use above a base metric (e.g. organizational metrics)
    *   Maybe we need a framework above the basic metrics, a framework how metrics can be combined and put in relation to gain insight. (a bigger-idea metric or composite metric)
    *   We have composite metrics now. Should we break them out into atomic metric?
    *   Maybe revisit this after the first release of metrics.
*   Evolution (GMD) WG
    *   No update
*   D&I WG
    *   Looking at the current metrics and determining level of completeness 
    *   What to do with focus areas that don’t really have a robust set of metrics
        *   With respect to releases. 
        *   Favored: Include all well defined metrics in release + disclaimer that there are more in-progress at the repo. 
    *   Should you focus on breadth or depth for the releases
*   Common WG
    *   Should Common WG have its own chaoss/wg-common-metrics repository?
    *   The chaoss/metrics includes more than just common metrics
    *   Differentiating the work and guiding people is challenging in its current use of chaoss/metrics repo
*   Website
    *   Goal: Representing the Working Groups on the website
    *   A link now exists under the Community to each WG website
        *   E.g., [https://chaoss.community/diversity-and-inclusion/](https://chaoss.community/diversity-and-inclusion/) 
    *   Currently, the WG README’s are pulled in to the website
        *   This breaks relative links
    *   Is the README too much text on the website?
    *   Should we have a small overview on the website only and link to the full information on the GitHub
    *   Maybe the WG maintain a ‘overview.md’ page. It can mirror the text
    *   Maybe remove WG pages from the website, because the details are already on the /participate page.
    *   Current pointers to WG in:
        *   Home
        *   About
        *   Participate
        *   Metrics (after release)
    *   Maybe remove the sub-pages
    *   Rename Community page, because it does not include the WG
        *   Maybe: “News”/Learn more/Blog/Social Media

            *   2. Code Quality: Understand the quality of a project's source code.
            *   3. Licensing: Understand the potential IP issues in a project.
            *   4. Transparency: Understand what dimensions of the project are visible organically or through metrics; or, in contrast, what is not visible but should be?
            *   5. Sustainability: How active is the community around a given project?

        *   Submitted a Birds of a Feather talk to Open Source Summit North America
        *   Metrics are based on public data (e.g., GitHub) and private data (e.g., labor cost)
        *   Value WG is first to tap into private data. First pass will be with public data. Private data is exploratory since we don’t know how companies will respond to this.
        *   There will be a protocol for private data. Similar to a benchmarking activity. 
        *   Publicly available can be, what data and metrics are of most interest.
        *   Working group is seeking people who are interested. Everyone is invited to join the weekly calls.

        *   Metrics in focus areas
        *   Content for metric detail pages
    *   Release cadence: TBD
*   How work is done in the WGs. Does variation matter? 
    *   Working groups accomplish their work differently
    *   Do we care about different processes within the working groups?

*   Releasing metrics
    *   Release Timing: Two weeks earlier than what was proposed
    *   Identify Metrics: To the working groups -- they need to figure out how to identify the metrics to release
    *   Suggestion: General guidance on what a metric should look like might be helpful for working groups to know what to work towards
    *   On the Webpage, inspired by [https://spdx.org/licenses/](https://spdx.org/licenses/) 
    *   Kevin created a prototype of release on metrics: [https://chaoss.community/metrics-rc/](https://chaoss.community/metrics-rc/)
    *   Will clicking on a link in the list take a user to a new page, or to an anchor further down on the list.
        *   A single page might be easier for a tool developer to align with (minor issue)
        *   What to do about back-button, UI experience.
        *   Create one PDF that contains all definitions. This could be a printout of the webpages
*   Matt G. is revising the website [https://chaoss.community/](https://chaoss.community/)
    *   Maybe have a dropdown from the Participate menu item that points to the working groups

Agenda: no agenda for weekly hangout

Video: [https://youtu.be/sdAePcK6bn4](https://youtu.be/sdAePcK6bn4) 

Attendees: Georg Link, Dawn Foster, Brian Profitt, Armstrong Foundjem, Sean Goggins, Ray Paik, Matt Germonprez, Vinod Ahuja, Matt Snell, Jesus Gonzalez-Barahona

Topics: 

Google Summer of Code



*   Google Summer of Code accepted. Still unsure of the total number of students allocated to the CHAOSS project
*   Consider how to connect the technical deliverables of GSoC with the work happening in the Working Groups 

Diversity & Inclusion Participation 



*   Participation is certainly on the rise increasing the number and diversity of participants in the Working Group
*   Consider how the success of D&I may be translatable to other Working Groups 

Developer Certificate of Origin 



*   The CHAOSS charter states: 
    *   All new inbound code contributions must be accompanied by a Developer Certificate of Origin sign-off ([http://developercertificate.org)](http://developercertificate.org)
    *   Discussion of how a DCO could be included in the current workflow of the Working Groups
    *   Potentially helpful links to provide insight: 
        *   [https://github.com/probot/dco](https://github.com/probot/dco)
        *   [https://github.com/concourse/concourse/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#signing-your-work](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#signing-your-work)
        *   [https://github.com/oVirt/ovirt-site/pull/1930](https://github.com/oVirt/ovirt-site/pull/1930) 
        *   **AI: Jesus** is going to explore how this could be implemented in GitHub

Versioning 



*   Conversation is happening at: [https://github.com/chaoss/metrics/issues/125](https://github.com/chaoss/metrics/issues/125)
*   We have three decisions to make: 
    1. Release versions or continuous delivery
    2. Release metrics individually or together
    3. Keep old version on the website or in the repository
*   Considerations include:
    *   Administrative overhead to manage releases
    *   Use of releases by stakeholders, including implementers, open source program officers, project managers, researchers
    *   Comparing metrics across implementations may be impeded if metric definitions changed - need version number to discover discrepancies between methods of how metrics were calculated
    *   Multiple released versions may result in implementations focusing on an older version by accident
    *   How to know what is current 
    *   Where to point people (website, git commit)
*   Discussions around release and versioning seem to go in circles. The Governing Board will make a decision at OSLS in mid-March. To prepare for this decision, Georg will summarize the conversation so far. We will discuss more on issue #125 until a decision is made or consensus is reached.
*   **AI Georg:** Synthesize options and considerations. Share with the mailing list.

Documenting



*   Update the _Participate _page on the website to include meeting minute documents for each Working Group’s call (D&I, GMD, Risk, Common, Weekly). DONE
*   Make sure to assign a notetaker for every meeting, building a single and growing document for each Working Group
*   Update the _Participate _page on the website to include a link to the YouTube channel. DONE


##  February 05, 2019

Agenda:



1. Publication of Metrics
2. Google Summer of Code
3. Pull request against metrics 
4. Working Group Updates
5. CHAOSSCON update/question

Roll Call

Who is on the call _(please add yourself)_:



*   Dawn Foster
*   Georg Link (notetaker)
*   Sean Goggins (facilitator)
*   Brian Proffitt
*   Ray Paik
*   Ben Lloyd Pearson
*   Armstrong
*   Tobie Langel
*   Ry Jones
*   Matt Snell
*   Kate Stewart
*   Ildiko Vancsa
*   John Mertic
*   Vinod Ahuja

1) Release and Publication of Metrics



*   Question arose from Common WG: At what point are we publishing and releasing metrics, so that customers of organizations can reference CHAOSS metrics definitions.
*   Continuous delivery of definitions: 
    *   Eliminate conflicts of different organizations working against the specification
    *   If we need versions, we have git commit hashes to reference
    *   Does not need a release cycle, only need to push all updates
    *   Counter: for tool developers it is easier to have a stable version. Moving targets can disincentivize tool creators
        *   SPDX tools got traction only after versions did not change as often
    *   Augur experience: work against a version of the metrics.
*   It would be great to have a 0.x release at Open Source Leadership Summit to have an announcement and get traction and attention.
*   We could setup an organizational page powered by GitHub. 
    *   Example of a GitHub page: [https://redhatofficial.github.io/#!/main](https://redhatofficial.github.io/#!/main)
    *   When a metric is ready for release, we can flag them and add them to the GitHub page
    *   Each repository can maintain their own release of metrics?
*   We need a page that becomes a single point of truth. 
    *   It needs to be updated regularly.
    *   Maybe start with updating twice a year? - Better start walking than to overthink.
    *   Example: SPDX license list. It is a versioned master list:
        *   [https://spdx.org/licenses/](https://spdx.org/licenses/) 
    *   Table and links. Maybe a duplicate of the github content. A templated version. 
        *   A tool can be run when we release, add a version number. And publish the snapshot.
*   How do we create this if work is done in different repositories. 
    *   We should be able to pull content from different repositories, as long as we keep the same format.
*   It would be great to repurpose the url: [https://chaoss.community/metrics](https://chaoss.community/metrics)
*   TODO: Workgroups 

2) Google Summer of Code



*   Our application is ready.
*   We have mentors lined up and ideas posted.

3) Pull request against metrics 



*   Sean addressed all of the comments. The pull request to clean up metrics repo should be ready. Will review and merge.

4) Working Group Updates

D&I WG 



*   Business as usual
*   Hyperledger is interested in piloting our D&I metrics within the LF

Common Metrics WG



*   First meeting today, before general meeting.
*   Working group is to work on metrics that have not been addressed by GMD and D&I Working group.
*   **AI Dawn:** Reach out to Kate Stewart and Daniel German who have a history with organizational affiliation metric.

GMD WG



*   Working on use cases
*   Will resume work after FOSDEM

5) CHAOSSCON update



*   Slides were uploaded before
*   Ray did MC
*   Kevin video taped session
    *   Will announce on mailing list when videos are ready
*   Tutorial sessions went very well in advancing metric work
*   Wish: Maybe instead of Lightning talks, have a 1hour unconference session. With workshops working really well, it would be great to have more of that work.
    *   Maybe use a MozFest style interactive sessions?
*   Next CHAOSScon should be at OSSNA.
*   FOSDEM talks were well presented.
*   Ask FOSDEM if they have a volunteer who can do the video recording and publishing for CHAOSScon next year.


##  December 04, 2018

Agenda:

1) CHAOSS Board Updates/Discussion

2) Workgroup Updates/Discussion - D&I and GMD

3) Software Updates/Discussion

4) Metrics Updates/Discussion

5) Outreach Updates/Discussion

6) Rotate Meeting Facilitator and Note Taker

Roll Call

Who is on the call _(please add yourself)_:



*   Matt Germonprez
*   Georg Link
*   Armstrong
*   Ray Paik
*   Ben Lloyd Pearson
*   Dawn Foster
*   Daniel Izquierdo
*   Matthew Snell 
*   Jesus Barahona 
*   Robert Sanchez 
*   Darianne Lopez
*   Vinod Ahuja 
*   Ildiko Vancsa
*   

1) CHAOSS Board Updates/Discussion



*   Last week.
*   Metrics workgroup: deprecate the chaoss/metrics repo page.
    *   Create a new web page /metrics → link to work in workgroup repos
    *   Because the work moved to working groups and maintaining metrics in different places is too much overhead and doesn’t make sense. 
    *   Standardize the readme of the workgroup repos to signal that they are part of the same CHAOSS project
        *   Nicole Huesman is working on the readme for D&I
*   Metrics versioning? (discussion during meeting, not governance board)
    *   Different preferences in the past: only use timestamps from repo commits versus version release
    *   Is there ever a need for users to refer to past versions of a metric release?
        *   For software vendors to reference which version is implemented
    *   Version number on metric or on package of metrics?
        *   AI Workgroups: Discuss what makes sense and make a recommendation.
*   Board wants to increase representation of workgroups on the board.
    *   Letters of interest will be circulated
*   Governing board is considering goals for 2019
    *   Goals from workgroups will define goals for overall project
    *   One goal would be to get implementation of metrics

Side conversation

- Quality, Risk metrics from Jesus research would be very interesting. European companies are careful about GDPR implications of the current metrics work. Challenge of parsers for different versions should need to be overcome. Industry is in need of those metrics.

5) Outreach Updates/Discussion



*   How can CHAOSS as a community (or a workgroup) retain the people in the workgroup and expand involvement who are on the mailing list? What are things we can do to encourage people to participate in the workgroups, because that is where the work is being done.
*   Idea: Announce to mailing list what easy issues are good to get started with. (D&I started doing this)
*   Idea: Instead of fixing small things, create an issue.
*   Idea: Share ‘good first issue’ on other places, such as Twitter.
*   Idea: Ask for feedback from industry experts. (GMD started doing this)
*   

Side conversation: Licensing of CHAOSS metrics / how to include industry

- What is the model for disseminating the metrics with industry users who develop metrics software? Why do we not hear more from people in industry who are on our mailing list? What is the value we provide to implementers in industry?

6) Rotate Meeting Facilitator and Note Taker



*   [https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/chaoss/2018-December/000218.html](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/chaoss/2018-December/000218.html)
*   For all projects, not just the monthly calls?
*   The weekly meetings (hangouts), no agenda, no notes.
*   For next meeting, January 8: 
    *   Facilitator: Daniel I., 
        *   Actions: Prepare agenda (updates from WGs, OSLS and other submissions), CHAOSSCon details, Outreach actions in place?, announce the meeting (mailing list), ask working groups about agenda items, engage people, enjoy the meeting ;).
    *   Notes: Matt G.
        *   Actions: Take notes and send out to list after meeting

Other stuff



*   GMD workgroup: 
    *   Wants use cases
    *   Works on visualizations
    *   Works on dashboards
    *   This is the pull request in grimoire-lab sigils with a proposal for a dashboard for CHAOSS Code Development metrics: [https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-sigils/issues/299](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-sigils/issues/299) 
    *   
    *   
*   Open Source Leadership Summit CFP is open: [https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/open-source-leadership-summit-2019/program/cfp/](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/open-source-leadership-summit-2019/program/cfp/)
*   D&I Workgroup

*   No updates.

Metrics Committee



*   Merging repositories: will talk about latr
*   Future of Risk and Value categories: will talk later

GMD Workgroup



*   Refining process to align more with D&I process. High-level 
*   Talk about merging in Risk and Value metrics.
*   Use cases: requesting from community managers. Not aligning with anything yet. Interested in raw conversations.
*   List of questions that resulted in good discussion [https://github.com/chaoss/wg-gmd/issues/33](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-gmd/issues/33)
*   Define contribution: start with commits

D&I Workgroup



*   New regular meeting time: Mondays at 9:30 CT
*   Good reception of the Tutorial at OSSEU. 
    *   Structure and format of the metrics presentation was validated. 
    *   Ethics discussion is important to people
*   Upcoming events:
    *   OpenStack Summit: Panel on Mentorship and potential to talk about CHAOSS D&I work: https://www.openstack.org/summit/berlin-2018/summit-schedule/events/22443/mentoring-program-reboot
    *   CHAOSScon: submitting a panel discussion, tutorial similar to OSSEU, and working session to involve the audience. Doc. ongoing work at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MzDk84BL7FfHDxbFxJz39M72V2Hfc5Y6oCPhOl6woxo/edit#
*   OpenStack reports are timed with releases. Asking for input for things to include. Report will be aligned with CHAOSS work.
*   Next: work on metrics more

Improving Repository Consistency between working groups



*   What was the need to split work in repositories 
*   Need of workgroups to have their own spaces vs. keeping everything aligned.
*   If we keep the repositories separate, we need to work make sure certain items are maintained consistently across each group
*   We need to implement mechanisms to make sure discussions of shared importance happen in a shared location, and discussions specific to each group happen within those groups.
*   We need to identify a way to ensure we have a central location where users can get connected to important resources within each of the repositories
*   CHAOSS Board will discuss this in our meeting later this month 

Future of Risk and Value metrics categories



*   Risk and Value metric categories have not seen interest transform into action. 
*   Proposal to merge Risk and Value with GMD and D&I. 
*   This may provide more activity around those metrics and streamline the CHAOSS story we can tell.
*   GMD workgroup was in favor of this proposal.
*   We would need to make sure that the metrics are merge properly and that it is clear which workgroup takes on which metric.

Discourse for CHAOSS



*   We have a discourse instance to supplement emails: [https://discourse.chaoss.community/](https://discourse.chaoss.community/)
*   Concern: fragmenting conversation by having mailing list and discourse. Problem could be created that people do not see the whole conversation as it is fragmented across different communication channels
*   Maybe we should pick one: mailing list or discourse, but not maintain both
*   Idea: have mailing lists that provide important information from discourse and link back to the original conversation (Discourse number one communication channel)
*   Email integration? Will there be ability to subscribe to topics and get notified via email?
*   AI Georg: evaluate Discourse more with regard to the questions
*   AI Georg: Start a discussion on the mailing list before we decide and move on.

CHAOSScon and other upcoming events



*   CHAOSScon EU 19 CFP closes Nov 26: [https://chaoss.community/chaosscon-2019-eu/](https://chaoss.community/chaosscon-2019-eu/)
