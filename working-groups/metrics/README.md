# Metrics

## 👥 CHAOSS Metrics Committee

The CHAOSS Metrics Committee defines implementation-agnostic metrics for assessing open source communities' health and sustainability. The CHAOSS Metrics Committee's goals are to establish implementation-agnostic metrics for measuring community activity, contributions, and health; and optionally produce standardized metric exchange formats, detailed use cases, models, or recommendations to analyze specific issues in the industry/OSS world.

### All the metrics are released within the "[**Release History**](https://chaoss.community/release-history/)" page on the CHAOSS website

## ✍ Process of getting metric approved to be visible on the website

* We already have many metrics listed under various working groups but you can also propose your own metric if you don't find listed in the existing metrics. [**Here is the list of all the existing metrics within CHAOSS**](https://chaoss.community/metrics/)
* There are different working groups that foster around their focus areas. So once you have a valid plan for your metric, we find a working group that is best aligned and has an interest in the metric.
* We add the metric to our [**Metrics Tracking Sheet**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tAGzUiZ9jdORKCnoDQJkOU8tQsZDCZVjcWqXYOSAFmE/edit#gid=0)
* Someone writes a draft for the metric using our [**Template for Metric**](https://github.com/chaoss/metrics/blob/master/resources/metrics-template.md) using google docs. The person proposing the metric could do this.
* The working group discusses the metric and makes the required changes.
* A markdown version of the metric is added to the working group repository.
* The metric is ready for the [**Continuous Metric Contribution and Regular Release**](releases.md)\*\*\*\*

## When should a previously released metric be returned to community review?

* Whenever there is a language or terminology change that would affect other metric references. 
* Changing the name of a metric \(in any way\)
* Any changes that go beyond grammar or spelling fixes in the sections: 
  * Question
  * Definition
  * Objectives
  * Implementation
* Does not require review:
  * Grammar or spelling fixes \(not including metric name\)
  * Updates to sections References and Contributors
