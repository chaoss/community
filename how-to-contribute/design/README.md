### What is CHAOSS design? 🖌 

As the community gathers around the topic of **Open Source Community Health,** all members participate in the choices about what action to undertake in designing and providing better user experience. It is useful to coordinate those choices and decisions by laying out some guidelines. Designers use such guidelines to judge how to adopt principles such as intuitiveness, learnability, efficiency, and consistency so they can create compelling designs and meet and exceed user needs.

Hence, CHAOSS design is a place where we solve design principle issues and improve the design structure of the community projects
