### What is CHAOSS design? 🖌 

As the community gathers around the topic of **Open Source Community Health,** all members participate in the choices about what action to undertake in designing and providing better user experience. It is useful to coordinate those choices and decisions by laying out some guidelines. Designers use such guidelines to judge how to adopt principles such as intuitiveness, learnability, efficiency, and consistency so they can create compelling designs and meet and exceed user needs.

Hence, CHAOSS design is a place where we solve design principle issues and improve the design structure of the community projects

### What are we trying to achieve? 🤔 

We are trying to:

* Improve user experience.
* Provide high-quality design solutions.
* Bring the community together to contribute to design-related issues.
* Bridge the gap between the designers and developers to follow the smooth process for the design solutions.

### How you can contribute? 💡 

* User Interface Design \(UI\)
* User Experience Design \(UX\)
* Graphic Design and Visual Identity
* User Design Research and Documentation

# Design Contribution

## Things you need to follow

Welcome! We’re glad you’re interested in contributing to the CHAOSS Community designs. Before contributing, please review the following values:

**Be Ambitious** - We appreciate to test new boundaries and take advantage of new
 design solutions. You should prefer to work with a genuine sense of continuously
 improving and striving to be the best that can be. 

**Be Minimalist** - We make sure that our designs are simple and straight forward which gives a better meaning to the design problem.

**Be Inclusive** - You should keep the user first in mind. Thinking inclusively is about considering diverse groups of people, how they will interact with your design problem, and their environments.

**Be Respectful** - We value the designer's efforts. So you should be respectful towards the community or the user you are interacting with in order to have proper feedback on your design solution. 

**Be Consistent** - The consistency helps us to maintain the momentum of the project and the improvements within the community designs.

## Different Design Contributions

### Graphic Design

This includes corporate design (logos and branding), Illustrations, marketing design (posters, banners), advertisements, communication design, and signage.

**Tools:** [**Adobe Photoshop**](https://www.adobe.com/in/products/photoshop), [**Adobe Illustrator**](https://www.adobe.com/in/products/illustrator.html), [**Figma**](https://www.figma.com/), [**GIMP**](https://www.gimp.org/)

### UI/UX Design

_**UI communicates with UX!**_ It includes designing the User-Interface screens for any web or mobile applications by putting different components like buttons, reads, clicks, animation, etc. User experience is determined by how easy or difficult it is to interact with the user interface elements that the UI designers have created.

**Platform:** [**Figma**](https://www.figma.com/) **or any other UI/UX designing platform**

### UX Documentation

It's design documentation that includes feedback from users, general researches about design, and any design workflow and process for the specific design problem. It also includes all the information regarding the particular design.

**Platform:** GitHub

## Getting Started

We don't have a particular platform for listing all the design problems but we follow this general process in order to accomplish any design goal:

* Come up with the design idea and discuss it on the CHAOSS mailing list
* Another way of contributing is to open an issue on the project repository and tell maintainers about your idea.
* Discuss your designing strategies and documentation
* Design on your canvas tool **Figma, Adobe Photoshop**. etc
* Discuss your design submission on the mailing list and on the GitHub issues. Don't forget to mention an appropriate label **design label**

# Design Workflow

## Our Process

We follow a 4-query procedure to solve the design issues. Each question is a step toward the completion of the product.

* **What do we want?** We need to initiate the requirement goals that define - what are we trying to achieve? How will it impact the CHAOSS community? 
* **What do we have?** We need to take into consideration the information we have - Do we have any set of design guidelines or information for the specific new goal that we are trying to achieve? 
* **How do we get what we want?** We need solid ideation in order to achieve any goal - Does the community agree to follow the new goal? Do we have any plans or processes to achieve the new design goal? 
* **What will happen when we do?** We need to understand the future impact for any specific design goal - Is the problem solved? Is this what you were looking forward to having? Will it create a better impact on the CHAOSS community? 

## Ways of Achieving

💡 **Plan** - You should be good to commence your design with planning as design inquires into the nature of a problem to conceive a framework for solving that problem. In general, planning is problem-solving, while the design is putting problems into actions.

🧐 **Research** - Make generative research together with the CHAOSS community members the requirements and assets that are needed. Check what impedes their productivity.

✍ **Document** - Documentation stands out as one of the most important parts of any implementation design goal. After making fair research you should write down all the requirements you need with the available resources.

🖌 **Design** - High time! Once all the objectives and requirements are defined, draft your thoughts into the canvas that will help in solving the critical design problem that you are trying to achieve.

🧪 **Test** - Testing is the stage in the design process that enables you to evaluate your design problem or service with real users and enables you to create more community-oriented design solutions.
