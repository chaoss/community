# CHAOSS Brand Style Guide
We also use a [slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BZSBa4Ttji95NTPwHcVjcu-CgiuwBezd/edit#slide=id.p10) to maintain the full version of CHAOSS brand style guide. For the logo design element and design style guide, you can also refer to the [design contribution guide](../how-to-contribute/contributing-to-chaoss/design-contribution.md).

This document is a guide to the brand communication style for the CHAOSS project. 
It was created to help you represent the project’s brand consistently. It explains what the CHAOSS brand stands for, how it’s expressed, and how the creative elements fit together in our communications. 
Use this guide as your roadmap as you commission, design or deliver any kind of communications related to, or in support of, the ***CHAOSS project***.

## Project Name & Logo

#### Project Name
The project name “CHAOSS” should be used in all caps to signify that it is an acronym, meaning Community Health Analytics Open Source Software. In a document, please use the full name “CHAOSS” or “CHAOSS project” in first mention; in subsequent references, you may refer to it as “this collaborative project,” or simply “the project” to avoid redundancy or clumsiness. 

#### Project Logo
The range of colors within the project logo communicates energy and symbolizes diverse perspectives and viewpoints coalescing into a beautiful circle, reflective of the CHAOSS community. The project logo can be downloaded at https://chaoss.community/media/ and also found in [logos](https://github.com/chaoss/website/tree/main/About/Media).

#### Design Files
Diversity is at the core of the CHAOSS project, and this [design file](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ew4EEKmX5A4-4xjgSWvX-g1NwLKM-4s6?usp=sharing), containing a variety of samples, assests, and previews, perfectly captures that value. It serves as a guide for all designs related to the project which you can use as a reference.

## Logo usage
#### Ensure ample clear space
Always maintain the correct amount of clear space around the logo to preserve its integrity and visual impact. The clear space ensures the logo can be seen quickly, uncluttered by any other information that surrounds it. The correct amount of space consists of the diameter of the “o” in the logo.

#### Size the logo appropriately
Always make sure to size the logo appropriately. Too small could affect legibility and reproduction. Minimum size of the logo should be ¾” wide (.75”)(54 pixels).

#### Use the correct colors
The primary logo is the ‘color’ logo, and should be used whenever possible.

Secondary reverse white and black logos have also been created for use, depending on application.
