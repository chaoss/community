## CHAOSS Community Contributions

### About This Document

This document is meant to act as a proxy for contributions that would otherwise not show up as a Pull Request. In an effort to surface, acknowledge, and celebrate these contributions, community contributors are highly encouraged to submit a PR to add details about the contributions they've made. We recognize the imperfections of this system, but it is a starting point. We absolutely welcome feedback on this system, which you can provide by [opening an issue](https://github.com/chaoss/community/issues) here in the CHAOSS Community Repo.

### What Counts as a "Contribution"?

If you are spending a block of time dedicated to CHAOSS, that counts as a "contribution," because we greatly appreciate your time and energy. But, if your contribution is already captured in a PR in a CHAOSS repo or org, it shouldn't be listed here. 

### Types of Contributions

We are very interested in including every type of contribution in our [Types of Contribution Metric](https://chaoss.community/?p=3432), so please add the type with your PR. If you don't see your type listed, please [open an issue](https://github.com/chaoss/community/issues) in the CHAOSS Community Repo and we will add it to the metric.
