# Outreachy 2022 Interested Candidates

Hi potential Outreachy mentees,

A few details regarding the application process specific to the CHAOSS project:

0) Please join our Outreachy Channel on Slack for Questions! https://chaoss-workspace.slack.com/archives/C036PGGRG01 

1) You must complete one micro-task related to the idea you are interested in. These are in the Outreachy directory they provide. 
2) Once you completed one contribution, create a pull request on this file below to add yourself, your information, and a link to your repository of the completed micro-task. This repository requires [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/) (DCO) sign-off; see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/chaoss/governance/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-or-document-change-contributions-github-interface) for details on how to sign your commits.

3) You are welcome to include in your repositories other information that could be of interest, such as open issues or pull requests submitted to the project to which you intend to contribute during Outreachy, contributions to other projects, skills, and other related information.

4) Using and submitting other people's work as your own is not allowed. If you use other people's work, be sure to acknowledge their work in your submission.

April 22, 2022 4pm UTC is the deadline for applicants to record contributions and create a final application. Make sure to also submit any additional information required by Outreachy. 

Regards,
Outreachy Mentors
