## Preparing To Submit Your Proposal

While it is not our intention to provide you with strict instructions on how to prepare your proposal, we hope you will take a moment to review the following guidelines that we have put together to help you prepare the best submission possible. To get started, here are three things that you should consider before submitting your proposal:

1. What are you hoping to get from your presentation?
2. What do you expect the audience to gain from your presentation?
3. How will your presentation help better the ecosystem?

There are plenty of ways to give a presentation about projects and technologies without focusing on company-specific efforts. Remember the things to consider that we mentioned above when writing your proposal and think of ways to make it interesting for attendees while still letting you share your experiences, educate the community about an issue, or generate interest in a project.

### Session Types

You will need to choose a session type when submitting:

- Session Presentation – Typically 25 minutes in length
- Panel Discussion– Typically 50 minutes in length. Again, all panelist names must be included in the submission, and all-male panels will not be considered.

### Abstract

This is your chance to *sell* your talk to the program committee, so do your best to highlight the problem/contribution/work that you are addressing in your presentation. The technical details are still important, but the relevance of what you are presenting will help the program committee during the selection process.

This is the abstract that will be posted on the website schedule, so please ensure that it is in complete sentences (and not just bullet points) and that it is written in the third person (use your name instead of I).

*Example: The proposed presentation will provide an overview and current status of the Linux Foundation's CHAOSS project. This will include a discussion of the CHAOSS project workgroups, with a particular focus on the technical advances that are being done with respect to understanding the growth, maturity, and decline of an open source project. The presentation will conclude with a discussion of future work of the CHAOSS project, as well as ways to become involved in the project. *

### Audience

Describe who the audience is and what you expect them to gain from your presentation.

*Example: The audience for this project includes organizational members who are interested in better understand the growth, maturity, and decline of the open source projects with which they are engaged. This could include corporate participants, community managers, and members from supporting foundations.*

### Benefits to the Ecosystem

Tell us how the content of your presentation will help better the ecosystem.

We realize that this can be a difficult question to answer, but as with the abstract, the relevance of your presentation is just as important as the content.

*Example: This presentation openly discusses the work that is being done in the Linux Foundation's CHAOSS project. Understanding the health and sustainability of an open source project is critical as an ever increasing number of organizations engage with open source projects for a variety of reasons. These engagements have become critical to the success of organizations and advancing our production of better metrics and software is beneficial to the entire open source ecosystem. *

### Experience Level

Select the experience level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Any) of those who should attend this session.

### First Time Submitting? Don’t Feel Intimidated

Linux Foundation events are an excellent way to get to know the community and share your ideas and the work that you are doing and we strongly encourage first-time speakers to submit talks for our events. In the instance that you aren’t sure about your abstract, reach out to us and we will be more than happy to work with you on your proposal.

### How To Give a Great Tech Talk

In the instance that your talk is accepted, we want to make sure that you give the best presentation possible. To do this, we enlisted the help of seasoned conference speaker Josh Berkus who has prepared an in-depth tutorial on “How to Give a Great Tech Talk”.
