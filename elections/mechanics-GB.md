# Guiding Principles

* Governing Board (GB) seats are held by individuals and not organizations. 
* Members of the GB should be exemplary members of the community who have demonstrated our community values. 
* The GB should be made up of individuals from different Working Groups, Software Subprojects, Chapters, and other groups within the CHAOSS project so that we have a diverse group of thought and input.


# Composition

* 2 seats are currently dedicated to our software subprojects, Augur and GrimoireLab. Those 2 seats are filled as described in the Charter section 2, bullet 3.
* 13 seats are filled in an annual election to determine the composition of the GB for the following year. 6 of those seats will be filled in one year and 7 in the following year.

# Candidate Eligibility

Any CHAOSS community member who has been actively participating in some part of the project consistently for the past 6 months can run in the election. Each candidate needs to be endorsed by 2 eligible voters to be able to run in the election.

There are no term limits for GB members.

# Voter Eligibility

Eligible voters include the existing GB, Chairs for our WGs (listed in[ https://chaoss.community/kb/working-groups/](https://chaoss.community/kb/working-groups/)), our software maintainers (listed in the MAINTAINERS.md files for GrimoireLab and Augur), anyone making a contribution to a CHAOSS GitHub Repository (see this [GrimoireLab table](https://chaoss.biterg.io/app/visualize#/create?type=table&indexPattern=0211efb0-14ca-11e9-8aac-ef7fd4d8cbad&_g=(filters:!(),refreshInterval:(pause:!t,value:0),time:(from:now-1y,to:now))&_a=(filters:!(('$state':(store:appState),meta:(alias:!n,disabled:!f,index:'0211efb0-14ca-11e9-8aac-ef7fd4d8cbad',key:author_bot,negate:!f,params:(query:!f),type:phrase),query:(match_phrase:(author_bot:!f)))),linked:!f,query:(language:kuery,query:''),uiState:(),vis:(aggs:!((enabled:!t,id:'1',params:(),schema:metric,type:count),(enabled:!t,id:'2',params:(field:author_name,missingBucket:!f,missingBucketLabel:Missing,order:desc,orderBy:'1',otherBucket:!f,otherBucketLabel:Other,size:15000),schema:bucket,type:terms)),params:(perPage:10,percentageCol:'',showMetricsAtAllLevels:!f,showPartialRows:!f,showTotal:!f,totalFunc:sum),title:'',type:table)))), and the people listed in[ https://github.com/chaoss/community/blob/main/community-contributions.md](https://github.com/chaoss/community/blob/main/community-contributions.md) for contributions made in the past year will be eligible to vote in the election. There will also be a private exception process enabled.

Before the start of each election, the election officers will work with each of these groups to ensure that the list of people is up to date and encourage people to add themselves to[ community-contributions.md](http://community-contributions.md/) in time for the election deadlines. Since anyone can add themselves to community-contributions.md, this will also undergo a short audit to avoid ballot stuffing or other abuse. 

# Election Process

Elections will be held using [Elekto software](https://elekto.dev/) for ranked choice voting, more specifically, a time-limited Condorcet ranking using the Schulze method. It relies on GitHub Oauth to log you in to vote, instead of relying on email. More details on voting are in the [Elekto documentation](https://elekto.dev/docs/). The top ranked candidates will be elected to the open seats.

## Election Officers

The Governing Board will appoint two or three Election Officer(s) to administer the election. Elections Officers will be CHAOSS community members in good standing who are eligible to vote, are not running for Steering in that election, who are not currently part of the Governing Board, and can make a public promise of impartiality. 

They will be responsible for:

* Making all announcements associated with the election
* Preparing and distributing electronic ballots
* Judging exception requests
* Assisting candidates in preparing and sharing statements
* Tallying voting results according to the rules

# Limitations on Organizational Representation

No more than two seats may be held by employees of the same organization (or conglomerate, in the case of companies owning each other). If the results of an election result in greater than two employees of the same organization, the lowest vote getters from any particular employer will be removed until representation on the committee is down to two.

If employers change because of job changes, acquisitions, or other events, in a way that would yield more than 2 seats being held by employees of the same organization, sufficient members of the committee must resign until only two employees of the same employer are left. If it is impossible to find sufficient members to resign, all employees of that organization will be removed and new special elections held. In the event of a question of company membership (for example evaluating independence of corporate subsidiaries) a majority of all non-involved GB members will decide.

# Vacancies

In the event of a resignation or other loss of an elected GB member, the candidate with the next most votes from the previous election will be offered the seat, provided that person otherwise qualifies to join the GB. This process will continue until the seat is filled.

In case this fails to fill the seat, a special election for that position will be held as soon as possible, unless the regular GB election is less than 8 weeks away. Eligible voters from the most recent election will vote in the special election. Eligibility will not be redetermined at the time of the special election. Any replacement GB member will serve out the remainder of the term for the person they are replacing, regardless of the length of that remainder.
