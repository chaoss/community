## Key roles and people

This is a CHAOSS Community project and should never rely on one person only.


### Roles

Each role is occupied by different people each episode.


### Organizers

The **organizer** is responsible for the invitation, scheduling, preparation, coordination, moderation, and monitoring the podcast email. Each episode has exactly one (1) organizer. An organizer is also a panelist.

1. Georg Link
2. Matt Broberg
3. Samantha Venia Logan
4. Dylan Marcy
5. Sean Goggins
6. ... (you?)


### Panelists

A **panelist** is responsible for research, asking questions, and adding to the conversation on the podcast.
These panelists have agreed to be invited to every new episode. Not everyone should be on every episode. Organizers are also panlists.

* Matt Germonprez
* Dawn Foster
* Kevin Lumbard
* Brian Proffitt
* Don Marti
* Nicole Huesman
* Daniel Izquierdo
* Andrea Gallo
* Kate Stewart
* Armstrong Foundjem
* ... you?


### Guest

A **guest** is requested to discuss up-front what they want to talk about and provide references.

We have a [Planning Guests document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qxmC1k8SayChurIq2r91CR3r_KAThTwaNEMjA6DLGhE/edit) to keep track of who we want to invite.


### Coordinator

A **coordinator** assists with the finer details of confirming podcast dates/times and acts as a central point of communication for all other roles. This role also sends out post-podcast thank you gifts. This is currently assigned to the CHAOSS Community Manager.

## Strategy

### Name: CHAOSScast

The CHAOSS community [discussed names on the mailing list](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/chaoss/2020-March/001205.html). _Aastha Bist's_ suggestion **CHAOSScast**  was an instant favorite. We considered longer names that were more descriptive but decided to go with the short CHAOSScast and leave SEO to the description

### Subtitle

The CHAOSS Community podcast elevates conversations about metrics, analytics, and software for measuring open source community health. 


### Description

This podcast fills the gap with open source community metric definitions and software on one side and their use in different contexts on the other side. We invite guests to this podcast to talk about how they use open source community health metrics and software in their own open source communities, companies, or foundations. The panelists are CHAOSS Community members who spent considerable time and effort to understand open source community health and how we can measure it through metrics, analytics and software.


### Goal

This podcast fills a gap in the CHAOSS community by sharing specific use cases for metrics and exploring how metrics are used in different contexts.


### Audience

Anyone interested in open source community and project metrics, including OSPO managers, Community Managers, open source Maintainers, Linux Foundation Employees, Community Members, DevRel managers

### Scope

* [Include] Interviews with people who do metrics for their community, project, foundation, or company
* [Include] Use cases, metrics that matter in specific industries (e.g., high regulated environments as banks)
* [Include] coverage of metrics platforms not considered for future integration into CHAOSS
* [Include] non-OSS markets such as marketing brand communities and corporate social circles
* [Include] active calls for experiments and/or data sets for ongoing case studies? 
* [Exclude] quantitative data metrics not related to communities but having much to do with general measurement including ROASS and Paid ad traffic
* [Exclude] developing situations and case studies that are more recent than one month or still ongoing


### Style

A panel of 2-3 CHAOSS members interviews guest(s) who have done or used OSS metrics in their specific context. The interview is about the specific use case of the guest. 


### Format

Each recording is scheduled for 1.5h and a released episode targeting 30-40 minutes. The following is the ideal structure:

* Intro music and intro to CHAOSScast
* Intro of panelists
* Intro of guest(s)
* Interview with guest
* Picks/shout outs


### Sample interview questions

* Tell us about yourself and your background.
* Tell us about the open source community and project metrics you use.
* How were these metrics decided on to be important?
* What decisions do you make based on these metrics?
* What tools do you use for the metrics?
* Who else sees these metrics and how are the metrics integrated in your workflows?
* "what amazing thing did you do?", "what was the community like before it happened?" "When did you realize something needed to change?" "how did you go about getting the thing done?" "what was the end result?" “why dos what you did matter to the listener’s communities?”  “what advice do you have to make doing the same thing easier?”


## Automation

Documenting any automation configured to date.

## CHAOSScast sponsorship and revenue


### Revenue background

CHAOSScast is part of the Rebase.fm which has sponsorship deals to fund the work on the podcast. Rebase.fm shares its revenue with CHAOSScast. Shared revenue will be deposited to [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/chaosscast).


### How much revenue?

$25 per episode


### How will the revenue be used?

This podcast is not about the funding, but it does come with some opportunity to invest further into the podcast and the CHAOSS community as a whole. 


#### Budget item: reinvest in podcast

Money in this budget can be used for:

*   Sending “thank you” notes and swag to guests of the podcast
*   Funding of regular hosts requests for equipment, e.g., microphone or headphone


### Revenue FAQ

1. What is the approval process for money distribution from the Reinvest in Podcast budget?
  * The CHAOSS governance team has delegated responsibility to manage these funds in good faith to the podcast coordinator and organizers. To request funding, send a request to: podcast@chaoss.community. The coordinators will follow the following guidelines:
    1. The request is denied if at least one organizer denies it. 
    2. The request is approved when at least two coordinators or organizers approve. 

2. What kind of “thank you” notes will go out to podcast guests?
  * The thank you note contains a postcard, pokerchip, and 3 stickers, all branded with the CHAOSScast logo.

3. Who is eligible to make a request for equipment? 
  * Recurring hosts in need of improving their audio configuration can make a reasonable request to the team. A guideline of a minimum of three (3) podcasts before making a request is recommended, but all requests will be considered based on need and availability of funds.

4. Where will these funds be stored?
  * Rebase.fm will make the funds available to CHAOSS through an [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/chaosscast). If the funds grow to a point of needing to transfer them to Community Bridge, the team will coordinate with the CHAOSS Governing Board Finance Committee to do so.
