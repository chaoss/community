# CHAOSS Community Handbook

The CHAOSS Community Handbook is a central repository for how we run the project. As part of our value of being transparent, the handbook is open to the world and we welcome feedback. Please make pull requests to suggest improvements or add clarifications. Please use issues to ask questions.

If you are interested in helping with the community handbook, [#105](https://github.com/chaoss/governance/issues/105) contains ideas for new sections.
