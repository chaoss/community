# Path to Leadership

## What does leadership mean to the CHAOSS community?

A leader🏅is someone who has specific decision-making power over some part of a group and thus additional accountability and can help with prioritizing and planning activities in the project.

> I think that a leader in the CHAOSS community is someone who helps advance the project by contributing directly and coordinating work with others. Leaders should regularly attend the weekly community meetings to report on the work of their respective working group.

> Leadership sets the tone for the culture, values, and communication style for everyone else. I think a CHAOSS leader \(whether it be informal or formal\) should embody and foster empathy, compassion, and respect for everyone else working on the project, no matter in what capacity. I think that being an excellent communicator and having a passion for helping open source projects prioritize and measure their community's health is also helpful.

## Why is leadership important to us?

We are a volunteer-driven👥organization which means the work within the CHAOSS community is focused around the creation of metrics and software which depend upon the contributions made by external individuals and communities. We need people to direct the vision of **creation,** **planning**, and **architecture** of new initiatives within the community in order to drive through the better objectives.

**The CHAOSS** community has defined its different set of leadership roles under a specific set of [**community guidelines**](https://chaoss-project.gitbook.io/community-handbook/community-guidelines) and [**governance**](https://github.com/chaoss/governance) policies.
