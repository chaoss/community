### CHAOSS Community Operational Documentation

This folder within the Community Repo is designed to house process documents for current CHAOSS community members. 

These documents are **not** included in our [Community Documentation on the CHAOSS website](https://chaoss.community/kb-chaoss-community/) but are still designed to be easily accessible for those working in specific areas. Currently, this includes:

- [CHAOSScast](https://github.com/chaoss/community/blob/main/community-operations/chaosscast.md) - How to plan, record and publish
- [CHAOSScon](https://github.com/chaoss/community/blob/main/community-operations/chaosscon.md) - How to plan 
- [CHAOSSweekly](https://github.com/chaoss/community/blob/main/community-operations/newsletter.md) - How to publish
