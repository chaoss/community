# CHAOSS Working Groups

Currently CHAOSS has following working groups

* [**Common Metric**](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-common): This working group focuses on defining the metrics that are used by both working groups or are important for community health, but that does not cleanly fit into one of the other existing working groups.

* [**Diversity, Equity & Inclusion**](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion): This working group aims to bring together experiences measuring diversity, equity and inclusion in open source projects.

* [**Evolution**](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-evolution): This working group focusses on refining the metrics that inform evolution and to work with open source software implementations.

* [**Risk**](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-risk): The working group focuses on compliance and risk metrics in Open Source Software.

* [**OSPO**](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-ospo): The OSPO Metrics working group aims to advance how organizations understand the value that open source projects can provide as well as the value of these programs / initiatives.

* [**Metrics-Models**](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-metrics-models): This working group develops models that include the integration of multiple CHAOSS metrics in a way that people would consume them in practice.

* [**Application Ecosystem**](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-app-ecosystem): This working group applies CHAOSS metrics in the context of an open-source app ecosystem. The mission of this working group is to build a base set of metrics that is focused on the needs of open source communities that are part of the FOSS app ecosystem.
