# Introduction

This document is to provide guidance to our working groups around the consideration of privacy and ethics while developing metrics. For instance, sometimes our metrics include PII (Personally Identifiable Information) and we feel it's important to flag this for anyone who is using this metric in practice. 

This guidance may also be useful to consumers of metrics.

This document may be linked from the implementation section of metrics pages when the working group has determined there are relevant privacy and ethics issues.

describing the levels of PII, proper handling of data, and other considerations for those using metrics in practice

# Guidance to Working Groups

Metrics compilation and publication may lead to privacy violations. Each metric must be examined for potential data ethics problems.

Data relevant to a metric may have heightened sensitivity. Working groups should consider sensitivity levels.

Organizations may be exposed to risks. These risks may flow from compliance with the GDPR in the EU, with state law in the US, or with other law. There may also be contractual risks flowing from terms of service for data providers such as GitHub and GitLab.
