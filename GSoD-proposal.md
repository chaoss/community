# Google Season of Docs Proposal

This document is the proposal for the Google Season of Docs which has to be submitted by the CHAOSS organization.

## Proposal Title - organization name

Create documentation for CHAOSS Software - CHAOSS

## About your organization

[CHAOSS](https://chaoss.community/) is an open-source project at the Linux Foundation focused on creating analytics and metrics to help define community health. Work in the CHAOSS Project community is largely organized around software and metrics. Additionally, user groups provide ways to consider how software and practices can support the deployment of CHAOSS metrics. The CHAOSS project was officially announced at the Open Source Summit North America 2017 in Los Angeles.

## About your project

### Your project’s problem

CHAOSS has many working groups where the community members work together to achieve specific goals. The goal of the working groups is to refine the metrics and to work with software implementations. Three key areas of interest that CHAOSS has concerning GSoD include: Website, GrimoireLab, and Augur. Each is described in more detail next.

The [CHAOSS website](https://github.com/chaoss/website/) is a WordPress site. The structure and templates for the site are managed directly in WordPress by the web-content group maintainers. Content for the website is collaboratively developed in website-related GitHub repositories. The content is pulled directly into the WordPress site using a WordPress/GitHub connector application. Webpages are broken down into GitHub content areas and GitHub markdown files are used to populate those content areas. The web content group would like to improve existing contribution documentation and create new documents were needed to improve website management.

[GrimoireLab](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab) is a CHAOSS toolset for software development analytics. It includes a coordinated set of tools to retrieve data from systems used to support software development (repositories), store it in databases, enrich it by computing relevant metrics and making it easy to run analytics and visualizations on it. [Sorting Hat](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-sortinghat) and [Perceval](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-perceval) are the two most stable and stand-alone tools in the GrimoireLab toolset. The documentation of these projects is very limited and not beginner-friendly. Recently, the community has decided to work on improving the documentation.

[Augur](https://github.com/augur) is a CHAOSS toolset for ontologically consistent data science and analytics, with fully traceable data provenance from the report, back through the analysis, persistence, and data source. Augur is now focused on developing tools that support increased Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in open-source software. Our documentation work on this project will provide the writer a chance to put their stamp, related to this theme, throughout existing and future documentation for Augur.

### Your project’s scope

The scope of the project to improve documentation for the CHAOSS website, GrimoireLab, and Augur. We aim to document existing practices and use these efforts to highlight areas for improvement. In all, engagement with GSoD is intended to support and improve the community member experience for all.

We are estimating a period of 6 months to complete this project with three technical writers working on the three individual projects. We have identified community members who are interested to volunteer for managing the project. We have also found three technical writers to work on the projects.

Volunteers:
-   Venu Vardhan Reddy Tekula, Santiago Dueñas (GrimoireLab)
-   Kevin Lumbard (Website)
-   Sean P. Goggins (Augur)

Technical Writers:
-   Kriti Singh (GrimoireLab)
-   Jaskirat Singh (Website)
-   Xiaoya Xia (Augur)

You can find their Statement of Interest in [GSoD-interest.md](https://github.com/chaoss/governance/blob/master/GSoD-interest.md).

### Measuring your project’s success
-   Documentation for each project should be created using the technologies preferred by the community.
-   Each technical writer will create a repository that stores the work and tracks the progress of their portion of the project.
-   The documentation should be beginner-friendly.
-   Co-oping up with deliverables and timeline.
-   Attending weekly meetings for sharing progress about the project with the community.
-   Engaging with the community through mailing lists and communication platforms.
-   Developing clear processes by which future community members can contribute to new and existing documentation.

## Additional information

### Previous experience with technical writers or documentation:

CHAOSS has participated in the Google Season of Docs 2020 program under The Linux Foundation. We had two candidates who have worked and completed their projects. Jaskirat Singh worked on creating a CHAOSS Community-wide Handbook and Xiaoya Xia worked on building documentation for the CHAOSS D&I Badging Project
