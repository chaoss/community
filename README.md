# Governance
CHAOSS community governance lives here. Things like Onboarding and Code of Conduct.

We work on the governance documents in this repository and once approved by the Governance Board will copy them to the wiki and maybe website.

## Onboarding 
Lead: IldikÃ³ Vancsa

OSSEU 2017 discussion notes:
- Where do people land? - first point of contact: Website
- Need a page for onboarding 
- Community -> Get Started Here
  - Start with tools used by CHAOSS and communication channels
  - Describe structure and purpose of community
  - Within the detailed description, of how the community works, point to the correct tools 
- Community->Events
- In future, maybe have a graphical representation of how to join and work in community

Next Steps:
- flush out the "Get Started Here" page on GitHub before moving it to the website.


## Code of Conduct
Lead: Georg Link

More information to be added later.
