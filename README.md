### How to become a maintainer

A contributor to this repository can be made a maintainer by existing maintainers. 
We currently do not have guidelines of when to add a new maintainer and the decision is in the discretion of existing maintainers.


CHAOSS community governance lives here. Things like Onboarding and Code of Conduct.

We work on the governance documents in this repository and once approved by the Governance Board will copy them to the wiki and maybe website.

## Onboarding 
Lead: IldikÃ³ Vancsa

OSSEU 2017 discussion notes:
- Where do people land? - first point of contact: Website
- Need a page for onboarding 
- Community -> Get Started Here
  - Start with tools used by CHAOSS and communication channels
  - Describe structure and purpose of community
  - Within the detailed description, of how the community works, point to the correct tools 
- Community->Events
- In future, maybe have a graphical representation of how to join and work in community

Next Steps:
- flush out the "Get Started Here" page on GitHub before moving it to the website.
