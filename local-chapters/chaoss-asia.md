# CHAOSS ASIA

## About

This chapter empowers community folks from the Asia Pacific region to become integrated into the CHAOSS project, contribute in meaningful ways to them and the CHAOSS project, and help build a solid CHAOSS global community. CHAOSS Asia aims to eliminate the barrier caused by languages, timezones, and communication channels faced by Asian community members, by providing a variety of localized participation channels to be part of the CHAOSS community.

## Participation Channels
