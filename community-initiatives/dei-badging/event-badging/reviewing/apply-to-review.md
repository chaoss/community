The reviewer form requests the following personal information:

* **Your Name:** Supply your full name. D&I Badging will not share the name with applicants or spread it unless you are willing to post your name on the website.
* **Your GitHub Handle:** This will be later added to the reviewer list in [reviewer.md](https://github.com/badging/event-diversity-and-inclusion/blob/master/.github/reviewers.md) file under the badge/event-diversity-and-inclusion repository once you become a member of the reviewer team.
* **Your Email Address:** D&I Badging uses your email address to contact and communicate with you, and will not share or publish it on the website.
* **Your Organization\(optional\):** You can choose not to share this information with us. D&I Badging asks for the organization to know the further background about you, and will not share or publish it on the website.

Below are the most important questions:

* **Who you are and why you're interested in the CHAOSS D&I Badging Program.** 
* **Your history with Diversity & Inclusion in Open Source.**

We will also ask:

* We want to know if you would like to include your name on our website as a CHAOSS D&I Badging Reviewer. If you agree with that, your name will show on the bottom of [D&I Badging Page](https://chaoss.community/diversity-and-inclusion-badging/).
* We also require you as a reviewer to identify and act upon any conflicts of interest. Please see the [D&I Badging Conflict of Interest Policy](https://handbook.chaoss.community/community-handbook/badging/reviewing/conflict-of-interest-policy) for more information.

The D&I Badging team will be notified once you submit the form. They will contact you through email to set up a meeting to explain the reviewing process.

After the meeting, your GitHub handle will be added to the list of [current reviewers](https://github.com/badging/event-diversity-and-inclusion/blob/master/.github/reviewers.md). There is a [badging bot](https://handbook.chaoss.community/badging/the-badging-bot) that assigns reviewing tasks - don't forget to open email notifications for D&I badging repository to avoid missing an assignment!
