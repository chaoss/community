## CHAOSS Metric Quality Checklist
This checklist is used for new metrics to ensure we follow CHAOSS quality standards and processes. 

### Process

- [ ] Add the new metric to release notes issue in working group repo.
- [ ] Add metric to the WordPress website.  
- [ ] Update the [Metrics Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tAGzUiZ9jdORKCnoDQJkOU8tQsZDCZVjcWqXYOSAFmE/edit) to indicate that the metric is under community review and add the Page Id. Update context tags and keywords if necessary.
- [ ] Create PR to add Page ID # to the stable reference URL at the bottom of the metrics markdown page.

**When above steps are completed:**

### Content Quality
- [ ] Required headings, context tags, and keywords have content
- [ ] If any, ensure links to other CHAOSS metrics work
- [ ] Optional headings that have no content are removed
- [ ] Contributors section lists those contributors that want to be named
- [ ] The name of the metric is the same in all locations

### Technical Requirements
