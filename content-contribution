The CHAOSS project uses a number of communications channels; whose use is focused on the following objectives:
- Increase awareness of CHAOSS project and related events, issues, and releases.
- Increase participation/contribution to CHAOSS project - including recruiting in contributors to GrimoireLab and Augur. 
- Coordinate communications contributors wish to share relevant items
- Contribute to CHAOSS website content

There are a number of methods that community members can use to share or author articles, blog content, website content and press releases.

The current project Social Media channels are administered by the process and people found here: 
https://github.com/chaoss/governance/blob/master/social-media-README.md 

If a contributor wants to coordinate a post from their own social channel in planned release with official @ChaossProj social media; please 
- Create an issue with the proposed coordination here: https://github.com/chaoss/governance/issues/new 
- Tag the @chaoss/content-group to trigger a review and coordination

For website content changes; these can be initiated either by creating an Issue (https://github.com/chaoss/website/issues/new)in the Website repository, or by 
starting a pull request and proposing changes. 


For articles, blog content and press releases, we are adopting a creation process that uses Github issues as a way to propose, have reviewed and actioned within the Governance repository.

- Create an Issue in github with proposed content https://github.com/chaoss/governance/issues/new 
- Include a mention in your Issue that includes @chaoss/content-group - this will notify the review team; and once reviewed, they will close the Issue with comments on the action taken. 
- Alternative method: Send an email to any member of the Chaoss Content Group
