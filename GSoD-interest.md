# Google Season of Docs 2022 Interested Candidates

Hi potential GSoD students,

If you are interested in participating in Season of Docs as a technical writer, first familiarize yourself with the [Technical Writer Guide | Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/tech-writer-guide).

Adding a link to your document below serves the purpose of Statement of Interest which has to be submitted by the technical writers. Please read about it, [Creating a statement of interest | Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/tech-writer-statement).

**Notes**
1. In the 2022 Season of Docs program, organizations work directly with technical writers to create, improve, and update documentation. Organizations select technical writers directly. Technical writers interested in working with organizations should submit a statement of interest, using the channel specified on the organization's proposal page.
2. Your statement of interest should include your contact information, information about your technical writing experience, and an outline of the work you would do with the organization. It should also highlight how you meet any specific requirements the organization has for technical writers. Read the project ideas page of the organization carefully to make sure you have included all the information they require.
3. Once you started working on the project statement, create a pull request on this file below to add yourself, your information, and a link to your statement.

**UPDATE:** This repository requires [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/) (DCO) sign-off; see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/chaoss/governance/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-or-document-change-contributions-github-interface) for details on how to sign your commits.
