# Google Summer of Code 2019 Interested Candidates

Hi potential GSoC students,

A few details regarding the application process specific to the CHAOSS project:

1) You must complete one micro-task related to the idea you are interested in. You can find the micro-tasks on the GSoc Idea Page at: [GSoC-Ideas.md](./GSoC-Ideas.md)

2) Once you completed one micro-task, create a pull request on this file below to add yourself, your information, and a link to your repository of the completed micro-task.

3) You are welcome to include in your repositories other information that could be of interest, such as open issues or pull requests submitted to the project to which you intend to contribute during GSoC, contributions to other projects, skills, and other related information.

4) Using and submitting other people's work as your own is not allowed. If you use other people's work, be sure to acknowledge their work in your submission.

You must complete these things by April 9, 2019 13:00 CDT. Make sure to also submit the information required by GSoC for applicants (i.e., project proposal), linking to it from your pull request to this file.

Regards,
GSoC Mentors
