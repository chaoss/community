# Apply for a Virtual Event

We make one distinction between virtual events and in-person events. The Virtual Event does not support the [Family Friendliness](https://chaoss.community/metric-family-friendliness/) metric because this is not currently a concern for virtual events.

💡 This page will help you with how to fill out the form, and provide perspectives on improving your event referring to the submission form.

## Virtual Event Badge Submission Form

* **Provide verification that you are an event organizer:** Only the organizer is eligible to apply the badge on behalf of event participants. Please provide substantial proof to show you are the organizer of the event you are applying for. A link with your name displayed as an organizer on the event website is ideal.
