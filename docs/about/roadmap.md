# Roadmap

This roadmap is our strategic plan that defines our goal or desired outcome and includes the major milestones that are needed to reach it.

### 📔 Metrics

The CHAOSS Metrics Committee defines implementation-agnostic metrics for assessing open source communities' health and sustainability. The CHAOSS Metrics Committee's goals are to establish implementation-agnostic metrics for measuring community activity, contributions, and health; and optionally produce standardized metric exchange formats, detailed use cases, models, or recommendations to analyze specific issues in the industry/OSS world.

### 📖 Metric Releases

The Working Groups within the CHAOSS are focused on releasing new metrics where metrics are identified and defined using a continuous contribution process. The metrics are officially released biannually following a 30 day comment period. [**Check out the metric release**](https://github.com/chaoss/governance/blob/master/community-handbook/metrics-release.md)\*\*\*\*

### \*\*\*\*👨💻 **Software Releases**

The software committee within the CHAOS community is focused on producing integrated open source software for analyzing software community development across the metric mechanism.

### 👥 Working Groups

The working group aims to bring together experiences measuring common metrics, diversity and inclusion, evolution, risk, and value in open source projects. Its main goal focuses on understanding from a qualitative and quantitative point of view how different things can be measured within the community.
