# A Quick Start Guide for Newcomers

There are three quick ways designed to meet, greet, encourage, and mentor newcomers to the CHAOSS Project. 
1. Every week we have an office hours intended to make it easy for you to ask questions, and find your place in the project with a supportive, experienced CHAOSS maintainer. You can join these hours from 9am - 11am USA Central Time. [This is a link to our Zoom Channel](https://zoom.us/my/chaoss)
2. We have a Slack Channel! And so many working group focused channels within it. BUT, we've reserved one ESPECIALLY for newcomers, and our community is highly responsive within it. This is the [Slack channel](https://chaoss-workspace.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-dqeab4ab-4XrH51rc4y_WXjN~uI~6rA#/). And THIS is the channel within a channel, called "#office-hours" where you'll be welcomed!

3. Augur software has regular workshops to help you learn how to see what CHAOSS metrics show you about the projects you care about. You can learn about the date's and times by signing up for our mailing list/newsletter!
