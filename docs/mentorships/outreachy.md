## About Outreachy ![](../.gitbook/assets/outreachy-logo.png) 

Outreachy is a paid, remote internship program. Outreachy's goal is to support people from groups underrepresented in tech. They help newcomers to free software and open-source make their first contributions.

Outreachy provides internships to work open source. People apply from all around the world. Interns work remotely and are not required to move. Interns are paid a stipend of $5,500 USD for the three-month internship. Interns have a $500 USD travel stipend to attend conferences or events.

Interns work with experienced mentors from open source communities. Outreachy internship projects may include programming, user experience, documentation, illustration, graphical design, or data science. Interns often find employment after their internship with Outreachy sponsors or in jobs that use the skills they learned during their internship.

**Outreachy expressly invites applicants who are women \(both cis and trans\), trans men, non-binary people, and genderqueer people to apply.**

**They also expressly invite applications who are residents and nationals of the United States of America of any gender who are Black/African American, Hispanic/Latin, Native American/American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander.**
